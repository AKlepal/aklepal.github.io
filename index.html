    <p> I currently work at Navistar and I just applied to become a data analyis in training! 
        What I do on a daily is build brackets from Cross members, Double dog bones and even Prop shafts.
        I was on the data team for our tourqe values and they saw I know a lot more than some of our data team and they are trying to get me to fill their open opsition.
    </p>

    <p>Before this I was a teacher, but left that job because of drama. 
        I also run my own art buisness on the side.
        I have sold my art at conventions like San Japan and Anime Fiesta!
